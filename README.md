Stack and Queue Using Linked List

How to Run the Program

Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Save the provided code to a file named stack_queue_linkedlist.py.

Run the program using the command:

python stack_queue_linkedlist.py

Purpose of the Code

The purpose of this project is to implement the Stack and Queue data structures using Linked Lists. This allows dynamic memory allocation and efficient element management, demonstrating key concepts in data structures.

Time Complexity

Stack:

push(): O(1)

pop(): O(1)

peek(): O(1)

Queue:

enqueue(): O(1)

dequeue(): O(1)

peek(): O(1)

I’m thrilled to share my latest project demonstrating my knowledge of data structures by implementing Stack and Queue using Linked Lists! This was an incredible hands-on learning experience that deepened my understanding of linked lists and dynamic data management.

Key features of this project:

Developed a Stack with constant-time push and pop operations.

Built an efficient Queue with enqueue and dequeue methods.

Leveraged linked list concepts to handle dynamic memory allocation.

Working on this project reinforced the importance of writing efficient, well-documented code. I faced challenges like managing node references effectively, but solving them enhanced my problem-solving skills and resilience.

I’m excited to continue exploring advanced data structures and algorithms. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
